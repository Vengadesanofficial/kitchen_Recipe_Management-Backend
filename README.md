On the server side, I used Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and various npm packages to develop a responsive kitchen recipe management application. This application allows users to add, edit, and save recipes, as well as create accounts. I also implemented authentication and authorization, ensuring that users must register or log in to save recipes, and each user can only view their own creations
